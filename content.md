## About Omnifood

We make hundreds of thousands of decisions during our lives. The choices we make and the lifestyles we live have a profound impact on our planet. In fact, our lifestyles are responsible for an estimated two thirds of global emissions.
We are trying to build a userfriendly website to make people aware about the impact they are making on the enviroment.
The main parameter we are using to calculate this is Carbon Footprint which is the measure of CO2 emissions by a person in year.
Almost every person generates or contributes in generation of carbon dioxide making it a very effective parameter for measurement.
We have our own Carbon Footprint calculator for this which you can use.
